# CS2-Simulations
Simulations of Market Behavior

Those simulations were done with the R statistical software in support of the analysis of a model of competition between firms with spuriously differentiated products. Firms choose not only prices but product format. Choosing the same format makes products easy to compare for a portion of consumers and thus reduces differentiation between products.

The model that is analyzed is published in Crosetto, P., & Gaudeul, A. (2017). Choosing not to compete: Can firms maintain high prices by confusing consumers?. Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 26(4), 897-922. https://doi.org/10.1111/jems.12212
