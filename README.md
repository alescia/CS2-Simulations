# CS2-Simulations
Simulations of Market Behavior

Those simulations were done with the R statistical software in support of the analysis of a model of competition between firms with spuriously differentiated products. Firms choose not only prices but product format. Choosing the same format makes products easy to compare for a portion of consumers and thus reduces differentiation between products.

The model that is analyzed is exposed in "Choosing whether to compete: Price and format competition with consumer confusion" by Paolo Crosetto and Alexia Gaudeul, working paper under submission.
